 * The Lift module implements a source-to-source transformation on
 * the nested let-expressions that may (or may not) have been introduced
 * in the naming phase. The transformation rule lifts inner let
 * expressions out. The transformation rule is:
 *
 * let x1 = (let x2 = e2 in e3) in e4
 *
 * is replaced by:
 *
 * let x2 = e2 in (let x1 = e3 in e4).
 *
 * Note that e2 may be a let-expression so the process iterates until
 * all let-expressions are lifted to top-level.
